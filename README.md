Diabetes Prediction Model with Front-End Interface
This project is a machine learning-based diabetes prediction tool designed to estimate an individual's risk of developing diabetes. The model uses key health indicators, including age, BMI, blood glucose levels, HbA1c levels, hypertension, and heart disease status, to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

Features:
Machine Learning Model: The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the provided health data and return a prediction of diabetes risk.
Front-End Interface: A user-friendly front-end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form allows users to input their health data and receive an instant prediction.
Interactive FAQ: The tool includes an FAQ section to help users better understand how the model works, its limitations, and how to interpret the results.
Model Performance: Detailed performance metrics of the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are displayed on the web interface.
Technologies Used:
Python: For the machine learning model and backend logic (Flask API).
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the front-end interface and interactive elements.
Flask: A Python web framework to expose the model as a service via an API.
How It Works:
Users input their personal health data through the form, and the model uses this data to make predictions about the risk of developing diabetes. The tool provides a clear and understandable result with helpful information on what the prediction means.

How to Use:
Clone this repository.
Run the Flask API to serve the machine learning model.
Open the front-end in your browser to interact with the tool and receive predictions.
Feel free to explore the code and contribute!

# Diabetes Prediction Model with Front-End Interface

This project is a machine learning-based diabetes prediction tool designed to estimate an individual's risk of developing diabetes. The model uses key health indicators, including age, BMI, blood glucose levels, HbA1c levels, hypertension, and heart disease status, to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: The model analyzes health data and returns a prediction of diabetes risk.
- **Front-End Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to input their health data and receive an instant prediction.
- **Interactive FAQ**: Provides answers to common questions, helping users understand the model, its limitations, and how to interpret results.
- **Model Performance**: Displays performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the web interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For the machine learning model and backend logic (Flask API).
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the front-end interface and interactive elements.
- **Flask**: A Python web framework that exposes the model as a service via an API.

## How It Works
1. Users input their personal health data through the front-end form.
2. The model uses this data to predict the risk of developing diabetes.
3. The result is displayed with a clear explanation of the prediction.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Flask API to serve the machine learning model.
3. Open the front-end in your browser to interact with the tool and receive predictions.
4. Download requirements to run the code
## 5. You may need to adjust file locations in the code to run locally.

Feel free to explore the code and enjoy.
